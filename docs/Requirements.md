## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for a Business Intelligence (BI) Report that will display Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for solar panel production and capacity, utilizing solar sensor data.

## Assumptions

- The BI report will be used by the solar panel manufacturing team to monitor and improve production efficiency.
- The solar sensor data is accurate, reliable, and available in real-time.

## FunctionalRequirements

- The BI report should be able to aggregate solar sensor data to calculate production and capacity KPIs.
- The report should provide a dashboard view that is easy to understand and navigate.
- Users should be able to filter and sort data based on different parameters such as time, location, and panel type.

## NonFunctionalRequirements

- The BI report should be accessible via a web-based interface.
- The data should be presented in real-time with minimal latency.
- The report should be scalable to accommodate increasing amounts of data.

## DataSources

- Solar sensor data will be accessed from the company's internal database.
- Weather data API will be accessed to correlate production with weather conditions.
- Maintenance records will be accessed from the company's asset management system.

## DataCuration

- Missing values will be handled by interpolation or substitution based on historical data.
- Data normalization techniques will be applied where necessary to ensure consistency.

## DataTransformation

- The following KPIs will be defined: energy output, efficiency, downtime, and capacity utilization.
- KPIs will be calculated using specific business logic, including conversion factors and operational thresholds.

## DataVisualization

- The following visualizations will be created: line graphs for trend analysis, bar charts for comparison, and heat maps for geographic distribution.
- Interactive elements will be included to allow users to drill down into specific data points.

## DataSecurityAndPrivacy

- All sensitive data will be handled in compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- Data access will be controlled through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Orchestration

- The data pipeline will be orchestrated using a workflow management tool like Apache Airflow.

## UIRequirements

- The BI report will be accessed using a standard web browser.
- The UI will provide a responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
- The UI will include user-friendly controls for data filtering and time frame selection.

## UserStories

- As a production manager, I want to monitor daily energy output so that I can ensure production targets are met.
- As a maintenance engineer, I want to analyze downtime incidents to minimize future disruptions.
- As an executive, I want to view capacity utilization trends to make informed decisions about plant expansions.
